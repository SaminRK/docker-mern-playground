# Dockerized MERN Stack Playground

This is a simple dockerized MERN application. Run using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The react app should open at `localhost:3000`


**Note** Built in a hurry. Not the best work. Was mainly built to understand `docker`. Will come back to incrementally improve the application.
